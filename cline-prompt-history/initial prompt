I want to start a web app from scratch. I want to use Python and I'm familiar with Django and Flask frameworks.
The main objective of the app is to assist the user in "fact checking" the information provided by a link, generally a news article or social media post. 
To achieve this, the app should include use of AI agents to understand the main facts found in the article, search for similar articles or official documentation about the same facts, and assign a score to each material, including the first provided article. That score will represent the accuracy of the material considering differences in the facts stated on each material, where official documentation can be considered a trusted source, while post and news should consider the "more frequently mentiones facts" as the best scored.
