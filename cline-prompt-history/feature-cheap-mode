Add a "Cheap mode" checkbox to be enabled by default on the analyze page.
Cheap mode will:
- Search for the link in all registered articles. 
- If found, show the corresponding report no matter if the original from that report is different from the consulted link.
- If not found, run an analysis that considers only 3 sources and no more than 3 useful sources.
