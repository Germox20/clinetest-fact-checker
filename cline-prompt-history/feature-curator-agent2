Let's add some small changes:
In the history page, make it so that clicking the name of the article opens the detailed report, and add an action button to open the article's link.
The Curator Agent will review each analyzed source before merging the results of the current analysis or creating the new report.
The Curator's review will avoid having multiple interpretations of the same fact comparisons (For example being both matching and conflicting), by following a set of rules to review the fact comparisons:
- When comparing numbers in both sources, a difference lower than 30% of the biggest number is considered a match.
- When comparing numbers with ambiguous expressions (like Many, Few, Several, etc) the following rules should apply.
+ 20 or lower = few | some | any
+ 20 to 50 = some | various | many
+ 50 to 200 = several | many | lot
+ 200 and over = huge | massive | big
- When a comparison is found both matching and conflicting, the Curator agent should reassess the fact from the corresponding source and determine which case fits better.
